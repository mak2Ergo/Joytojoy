# Joytojoy 
Joytojoy is a versatile HID (human interface device) that allows power wheelchairs users to use their wheelchair's controller to play on a video game console or control a smartphone, PC...
Its principle of operation is quite simple. It is a box connected by an USB cable to the device to be controlled which is fitted in place of the standard wheelchair's joystick knob. Joystick movements are detected by a motion sensor (an inertial measurement unit) and translated into a signal for each system to be controlled.
